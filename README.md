Project Name: Mapping Employees
By Melina Diaz and Tracy Charles

Description:
We created a tool a company can use to see where its employees are living based on available data. This information is intended to help companies decide where to build offices. In this project, we used the Person Search API from People Data Labs to obtain the necessary data in a .csv file.

Output:
The output of the function is an interactive plot with points for each employee. The red point represents the company headquarters and the rest are points of the employee addresses. If you hover on a point, you will be able to read their latitude, longitude, job title, and latest school.
